            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>Retro is back, baby! At last, I can make my shameful curried sausage love public. As a meal, it has enough kick to know you’re alive, but it’s not too spicy for kids, 
                making it an ideal midweek dinner for families – and it’s pretty easy on the budget too! When craving curried sausages, this is the recipe I always use. 
                The natural sweetness of carrots coupled with the fruity chutney is a perfect match for the piquant curry powder and hearty sausages. Curried sausages can be served with 
                rice (as a nod to curry) or mashed potato (hello bangers)! My guilty pleasure, however, is serving it with the sausage already cut up, in a bowl, with thick 
                slices of buttered bread, on the couch!</p>
